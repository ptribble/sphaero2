H now toggles hide, for pause and resume

Smarten up message dialogs.

Tidy up build warnings.

Better checking of command-line arguments.

Fix the check for image searching so it terminates.

Smarten up error dialogs.

Use variables for min/max number of pieces.

Fix static method call warning.

Fix generic use of ListIterator.

Remove unnecessary casts.

1.4

Remove applet; applets essentially don't work on the modern web.

Add sample selector. (The sample packages drop images into the correct
places.)

1.3

Mostly tweaks for packaging

1.2

Applet version. See README.APPLET. There are known bugs - occasionally
all the pieces end up in a corner (S to shuffle them) and sometimes the
keys don't work initially.

Refactoring in places aligned with the applet; some common code moved
into JigUtil.

1.1

Resize the image a little smaller. This makes it easier to handle as
there's more space around the edges to hold pieces.

Harmonize code and variable names in RectCutter and SquareCutter

Cleaned up some pmd warnings and missing javadoc

1.0

Created a build script

unix linefeeds

add manifest so you can java -jar it

pmd clean

lint clean

replace iterators by enhanced for loops

Rely on booleans being initialized to false

Random image selection ignores files that contain the string "thumb"

JigsawFrame shows the window before it starts reading the image, so you
know something has happened.

Resize large images so they fit on screen.

jstyle clean

OKCancelPane removed; inlined into JigsawFrontEnd

Minor optimization: a 180 rotation means we can just reverse the image
array, we don't have to walk it in 2 dimensions

JigsawFrontEnd implements ActionListener

Slight refactoring of JigsawFrame

Removed Tests

JigsawCutter made an abstract class rather than an interface

Common code moved into JigsawCutter

Remove unused width/height ratio from Classic Cutters

SquareCutter has variable piece counts

RectCutter has variable piece counts

Remove VariableCountCutter, JigsawCutter now has variable piece counts

Toolbar on main frame

Remove 'H' key accelerator, as it's a menu item

The random image finder filters on images, so works on directories
containing a mixture of images and non-images.

JigsawFrame accepts all valid cutter names as arguments now.

Option to show a small version of the picture so you can see what
you're trying to solve. This is modal so you have to dismiss it while
solving the puzzle.

Modernized usage of setMnemonic.

JigsawFrontEnd file chooser has an image preview.

All variables and methods explicitly scoped

All if and for statements have braces

Startup progress indicator

'P' pushes the top piece to the back

Remove overridden setImageData from MultiPiece

Merge JigsawFrame and JigsawFrontend

Implemented New Image menu item

Keyboard left and right rotate pieces as well as e and r.

Add indication of elapsed time and solution time

Renamed to sphaero2

Moved packages from net.sf to uk.co.petertribble to reflect the fact
that it isn't the sf project any more
